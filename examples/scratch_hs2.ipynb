    "- dpo and ipo accuracy are not as good as just looking at the first divering token. This makes sense as DPO considers the probability of the whole completion, this is problematic as longers completions are less likely. IPO is better, it consider all tokens equally, but we don't actually want to a consider later tokens. Imagine a string that starts with an unlikely token SolidGoldMagikarp, then continues with a very likely lorem ipsum. IPO would consider this completion very likely, but it's actually unlikely to be selected. Instead we only consider the first divering token. \n",
    "- For example if we are comparing [\"The cat is on the mat\", \"The dog is on the mat\"], then the first diverging token is \"cat\" and \"dog\". We can then compare the logprobs of these tokens directly to get the best score."
